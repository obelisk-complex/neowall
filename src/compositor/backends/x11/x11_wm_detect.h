 * the hint and stacks it as the desktop. With no WM nothing would stack it for

 *
 * The wallpaper window is created override-redirect when no WM is running (so
 * XLowerWindow + the raise-the-other-children loop can stack it) and managed
 * when one is (so the WM stacks it as the desktop). Both edges have to be acted
 * on, and in both directions the window must be *recreated*: override_redirect
 * is fixed at XCreateWindow time.
 *
 *  - WM appears (we are override-redirect): recreate managed. A wallpaper daemon
 *    autostarted at login routinely wins the race against the WM; without this it
 *    stays override-redirect for the whole session and paints over every window
 *    the WM later maps.
 *
 *  - WM disappears (we are managed): recreate override-redirect. This restores
 *    exactly the state the daemon would have been in had it started with no WM
 *    running, which re-arms the XLowerWindow path. It is not optional: observed
 *    on Xvfb under metacity, and under a deliberately reparenting test WM, the
 *    wallpaper window's contents are lost when the WM dies and — for a static
 *    image, where needs_redraw is cleared after the first frame (eventloop.c) —
 *    are never repainted, leaving the wallpaper permanently black.
 *
 *  - env_forced: the user pinned the choice with NEOWALL_X11_OVERRIDE_REDIRECT;
 *    never override it in either direction.
 *
 * Both edges are idempotent: the action depends on the window state we actually
 * have, so a repeated PropertyNotify for an unchanged situation does nothing.
 * The caller debounces the WM-disappeared edge (see X11_WM_GONE_DEBOUNCE_MS),
 * because a WM restart flaps the property down and straight back up. */

/* How long to wait, after _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK says the WM is gone, before
 * believing it and recreating on the override-redirect path.
 *
 * A WM restart (`metacity --replace` and friends) tears the old WM down and
 * brings a new one up; if the property is briefly absent or stale in between, an
 * undebounced down-edge would destroy and recreate every wallpaper window, only
 * to do it again when the new WM announces itself. Waiting and re-probing turns
 * that into a no-op, at the cost of the wallpaper being stale for up to this long
 * after a genuine WM crash. */
